# So we have to define the set of possible characters that may follow another character with respect to our data.

# In short: In a bigram model, we predict the next character using a probability distribution over vocab_size possible characters.

# Since we're planning to make computations on our data we have to define an encoding procedure to represent our data numerically.
# Below is a very simple code snippet that defines an encoding & decoding procedure for our data.

# Please feel free to try it out..

# Now that we have defined the vocab and the encoding and decoding procedure let us encode and split our data.
# When training a model, we want to measure its performance on unseen data to ensure it generalizes well.
